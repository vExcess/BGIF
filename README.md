# BGIF
Better Graphics Interchange Format - It's GIF but better

## History
Khan Academy has a very sandboxed editor that doesn't allow you to display images the normal way. However for as long as it has existed people have wanted to display images on Khan Academy. In 2014 Bob Lyon released his revolutionary Imagenator which converts images to strings that can then be displayed on Khan Academy using a simple decoder. However his Imagenator used an ad-hoc encoding which's compression capabilities were not the best. In 2019 Bob Lyon delivered again having ported a PNG decoder library to KA's environment. In 2021 I ported a JPEG decoder to Khan Academy. JPEG provides extremely good compression however the codec for it is 41 KB. In 2022 I ported QOI to Khan Academy. QOI compression is almost as good as PNG, nearly 50 times faster, and its codec is only 13 KB. I also tried making a GIF decoder, but that failed miserably.

However during all these years my obsession with compression was growing as I experimented with every single compression algorithm my feeble brain could come up with. Over the years I have released over a dozen different iterations of my own image formats which have grown better over time. I created my own Imagenator which provided far superior compression to Bob Lyons imagenator and only weighed in at a mere 1.6 KB. My last was a format that resulted in images only 1.4x larger than PNG and the decoder was only a mere 1.5 KB.

## Format Type
PNG is the goto for lossless images and JPEG the goto for lossy images. I could probably beat PNG and JPEG in compression ratios, but I don't need to since Google has created WebP. WebP supports lossless compression, lossy compression, still images, animated images, no-transparency, transparency. Basically WebP can do everything that all other formats can do but better. Lossless WebP images have better compression than PNGs and lossy WebP images better than JPEGs, and who needs GIF when WebP supports animation. Google has put a lot of work into WebP to make it the best it can be and I don't have any chance at beating it.

Even though I can't make a better general purpose image format than those that already exist, I can still make a better niche format than those that already exist. TIFF already is a format that allows reversable edits. QOI is already exists to be very fast while still providing decent compression. SVG could be improved, but I'm doing bitmap graphics not vector ones. One thing that's interesting is that even though WebP supports animation and has better than compression than GIF nobody uses it and everyone still uses the ancient GIF format. I think this is because GIF is a nostalgic format; the dithering gives off a unique memey vibe that no other image format has. GIF's compression isn't even that great, but because no other format was created to be like GIF but better people have stuck to using GIF. PNG and WebP were meant to replace GIF, but they weren't meant to be like GIF. In conclusion I am attempting to create a new image format that is better than GIF while still having the same vibe to it.

## About
BGIF is basically just meant to be the same thing as GIF but with superior compression capabilities. GIF only allows 256 colors. Likewise BGIF also only allows 256 colors. I could very easily make BGIF capable of storing millions of colors without any significant overhead, but at that point I would just be creating a new general purpose image format. Therefore I am artificially restricting the format to 256 colors in order to preserve the GIF feel. I could also easily allow 8 bit transparency, but that wouldn't be true to the GIF vibe so I'm artificially restricting the format to 2-bit transparency which is 1 bit more than the original GIF format.
